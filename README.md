### What's this?
- The window and controls above are part of a small Bitsy game you can play to get to know me.
- Use the arrow keys to move and interact with objects.
- Gameplay is collaborative, so anyone visiting my GitHub profile controls the same character.
- Credit to @nathanfarlow and @arxenix for the concept.
